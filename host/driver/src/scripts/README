WHAT:

This directory contains the define macro processor scripts

WHY:

It is in our interest to maintain as much code in common between our Linux and windows
drivers as possible.

To upstream drivers to the Linux Kernel repository, we don't believe that many of the
adaptions made to the source code that is common between Linux and Windows meets the
upstreaming requirements for Linux. This means that the linux upstream core must be
modified automatically before upstreaming the driver.

We don't believe Windows has this issue. Thus, the Windows version of the code is the
universal version, that is, with the original macros and ifdefs left intact. It will
be functional for both linux and windows, and in fact this should be verified
regularly.

HOW:

There are two facillities used to automatically edit the code. They are:

1. Changing #ifdef statements to normal code. This is done by removing all #ifdef targets
   that have the prefix CAVIUM_ONLY.

2. Replacing macro definitions with their Linux equivalents.

Both of these are effectively performing the same job that the C/C++ preprocessor does,
but doing that selectively.

TOOLS:

For #ifdef editing, we use the off the shelf tool unifdef (see man page).

For select macro evaluation, the scripts in this directory execute this job.

SCRIPTS:

create_linux_upstreamable

Expects the environmental variable LINUX_HOST_DRIVER_SRC and LINUX_HOST_DRIVER_SRC_UPSTREAM to be
set in the environment. The first contains the current path of the Linux driver source tree.
the second contains the path of where the upstream copy is to be placed. Any previous contents of
upstream tree are removed -- the upstream tree is entirely derived from the normal tree.
The entire linux driver source is then copied to the upstream tree. Then all of the macros that
need to be removed from the upstream tree are removed and replaced by their equivalent Linux
content.

Note this command should be executed from the scripts directory. It is designed to be execute
by a Make.

replacemacros [root_directory]

Expects the root directory of the source to change. All .c and .h files in the target tree are
replaced with their Linux equivalents. Most of the macros are of the simple form:

#define original_macroname(parameters) replacement_macro_name(parameters)

or

#define original_macroname replacement_macroname

In the first form, all of the contents of the parameter list between the MAXIMUM length 
of characters between parenthesis are moved to the new macro definition.

If the macro does not fit into one of the simple forms listed above, an exception is written
into the replacemacros script itself.

In addition replacemacros will skip files that define macros, to prevent recursive definition
issues. The files are in an exception list in the source.

USAGE:

Use the following make targets:

make linux_upstream

Executes the create_linux_upstreamable script above.

make host_drv_upstream

This is the same as a host_drv make, but takes place in the Linux upstreamable copy, and does a
make clean first, always. Then, the upstreamable driver source is tarballed for inclusion in
kernel.org.
