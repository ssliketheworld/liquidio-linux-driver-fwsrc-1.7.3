LiquidIO SE firmware for CN73XX NVMe controller.
===============================================
Release 0.0.6
=============
* Fixes for most of the bugs found in v0.0.5
* Added NVME Stats framework and host utility.
* Modified error handling on internal resource crunch to gracefully abort the command

Known issues:
* Intermitted crash in NVME+SATA mode while running tnvme test suite several times

Release 0.0.5
=============
* support for nvme cn73xx pass 1.1
* Verified compare & fused commmand functionality
* Error reporting in linux block layer and other bug fixes

Known issues:
* Few intermittent failures with tnvme test suite when running on cn73xx pass 1.1

Release 0.0.4
=============
* Support for presenting upto 255 SATA disks as NVMe name spaces.
* Abort handling is verified.
* Interrupt coalescing is enabled by default and a boot paramenter is
  provided to disable it.

Know issues:
* Async event registration and event reporting is not complete.

Release 0.0.3
=============
* NVME+SATA support. i.e Support for presenting SATA disks as NVME name spaces.
* Support for discontiguous IO queues is added.
* Added support for interrupt coalescing admin commands (set_features admin cmd).

Know issues:
* Abort handling is not verified.

Release 0.0.2
=============
* Support for SRIOV is added
* namespace and mapping generation tool to generate name spaces and map NS to
  controllers is included
  is included.
* Default namespace configuration is, 1 NS per NVMe controller for first 32
  controller i.e 1PF and 32VFs.
* No support for interrupt coalescing nvme admin commands.
* Support async event registration and log page reporting is there, but right
  now no event/errors are posted.
* Support for IO sizes > 8KB is verified.

Know issues:
* Doesn't have support for discontiguous queue though the support is
reported in nvme cap register.
* Abort handling is not verified.

Release 0.0.1
=============
* Early access 73xx nvme release.
* Supports PF2 alone, doesn't claim support for SRIOV on PF2.
* NVMe firmware is verified with CentOS/RHEL 7.0 and Ubuntu 14.04.2 but
  expected to work with all standard stock drivers of Linux and windows flavors.
* Presents two name spaces of size 100MB each. README.txt includes the steps to
  change default configuration, recompile and reload the firmware.
* Name spaces provides the data integrity in a single boot but are volatile.
  Disk data is not preserved with firmware reboots.
* Name spaces are verified for stability with tools like fio, dd at block sizes
  512, 4K and 8KB. Minimal verification is done at block sizes > 8KB.
* Data integrity is verified with mkfs.ext4, mount, file copy and umounts.
* No support for interrupt coalescing nvme admin commands.
* No support for thin provisioning and T10 DIFF.
* No support for discontiguous IO queues and SG list for IO commands. Supports
  PRP lists alone.

Know issues:
- Async event registration and log page reporting are not verified.
- IO errors are observed at block sizes > 8KB.
- IO Abort handling is not verfied.
- UUIDs are not implemented for name spaces.
